Celer
======

Celer is a library exposing many scikit-learn like sparse models missing from scikit-learn.
It estimates these models with the Constraint Elimination for the Lasso with Extrapolated Residuals (Celer) algorithm [1].
The solvers used allow for solving large scale problems with millions of features, **up to 100 times faster than scikit-learn**.

Currently, the package handles the following problems:

- Lasso
- weighted Lasso
- sparse Logistic regression
- weighted Group Lasso
- Multitask Lasso.

The estimators follow the scikit-learn API, come with automated parallel cross-validation, and support both sparse and dense data, with optionally feature centering, normalization, and unpenalized intercept fitting.


Install the released version
----------------------------

From a console or terminal install celer with pip:

::

    pip install -U celer


Install the development version
-------------------------------

We recommend to use the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.
First clone the repository available at https://github.com/mathurinm/celer::

    $ git clone https://github.com/mathurinm/celer.git
    $ cd celer/
    $ pip install -e .

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

    $ python -c 'import celer'

and it should not give any error message.

From a Python shell you can just do::

    >>> import celer
